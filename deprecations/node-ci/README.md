# [DEPRECATED] Node CI

> The official Node Docker image now ships with `npm@6.1.0`, which includes `npm ci`.

A simple Node image based on Alpine Linux, ready for usage in CI pipelines.
It contains the most up-to-date NPM version allowing usage of `npm ci`.
Use this image until the official Node image is updated with the latest NPM.
