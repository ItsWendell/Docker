# [DEPRECATED] Node Sentry CI

> Starting from `@sentry/cli@1.31.0` the official binaries have been patched to work out-of-the-box on Alpine.

A simple Node image based on Alpine Linux with build in sentry-cli support, ready for usage in CI pipelines.
It also provides out-of-the-box sentry support by using the prebuild Alpine binary as intermediate container.
See https://hub.docker.com/r/bycedric/node-ci/ for info about the base image.
