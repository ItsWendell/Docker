# Node Sentry CI

A simple Node image based on Alpine Linux with build in sentry-cli support, ready for usage in CI pipelines.
It also provides out-of-the-box sentry support by using the prebuild Alpine binary as intermediate container.
See https://hub.docker.com/r/bycedric/node-ci/ for info about the base image.
